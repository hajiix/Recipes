        <h2 class="header">History</h2>
        <p>
          Canjeero is one of the many types of flatbread that can be found in
          the horn of Africa. Though its origin is unknown, some theories
          suggest it was found between the 8th and 10th centuries. However, I
          believe it's been around longer than that, but it's hard to pin point
          an exact time because most of Somali history has only been recorded
          orally. Canjeero is a staple of Somali culture, and has been
          introduced to the rest of the world the past few decades by the Somali
          Diaspora. Dallac Balaash is essentialy a tomato soup. The literal
          translation of dallac is stir fry and balaash is having no worth. This
          is because in Somali culture, every soup must have some form of meat,
          but with dallac balaash, there isn't any meat so it's referred to as a
          fake soup with no meat(harsh i know)! As you can see, Somalis
          <em>love</em> their meat.
