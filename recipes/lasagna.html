        <p>
          Lasagna was originally created by the Greeks long ago. Their version
          consisted of layers of pasta and sauce. The Greeks used a pointed
          stick to eat it. However, it was the <em>Romans</em>, known for
          embracing local customs, who truly popularized it. The lasagna we know
          today originates from Naples, Italy, where chefs modified previous
          versions to make it even more delicious. It was first introduced to
          Italians in the 14th century during the Black Plague and was then
          regarded as a delicacy, often reserved for special events and
          holidays.

        <ol>
          <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
          <li>
            Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over
            medium heat until well browned.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water.
            Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt,
            Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for
            about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
            noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and
            rinse with cold water.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2
            tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
          </li>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
          <li>
            To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a
            9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce.
            Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the
            mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over
            mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan
            cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with
            cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake
            for an additional 25 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
