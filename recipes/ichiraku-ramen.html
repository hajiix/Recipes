        <p>
          Ichiraku Ramen is a dining establishment in the Naruto anime series.
          It was founded by Teuchi thirty-four years before the start of Part
          II. Ichiraku Ramen offers various toppings, such as char siu and
          boiled eggs. Ichiraku Ramen has also been Naruto Uzamaki's favorite
          dish since the beginning of Naruto. You often see Iruka sensei
          accompany Naruto at Ichiraku Ramen. In our world, there is a
          restaurant called Ramen-Ichiraku in Fukuoku, Japan. This restaurant is
          also near where Masashi Kishimoto(the creator of Naruto) went to
          university.

        <h2 class="header">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>2 Packages of Top Ramen</li>
          <li>
            About 5 cups of pork or beef broth (You can use the stuff in a box,
            the stuff in a can, or the cubes or the paste)
          </li>
          <li>Pork tenderloin</li>
          <li>2 Eggs</li>
          <li>1 Baby bok choy</li>
          <li>1 Green onion</li>
          <li>Soy sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="header">Optional Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Aburage - This is a type of soy product that's used when you make
            inari-zushi. It's some of my favorite stuff, and you should be able
            to find it at an Asian food store.
          </li>
          <li>
            Nori - This is those black/green sheets to the left of the image.
            You'd probably be able to find this at any grocery store with an
            Asian foods section.
          </li>
          <li>
            Kamaboko - This is that white thing with the pink swirl. Its made of
            a sort of fish paste that is steamed into like a cake. I know it's
            kind of distintive in the Naruto ramen, but I didn't have time to go
            and grab some from an Asian food store (which is where you'd have to
            get it).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="header">How to Make Ichiraku Ramen Step-By-Step</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Marinate the tenderloin for at least 3 hours. You can use just soy
            sauce, or a mixure of whatever other Asian sauces you want. Teriyaki
            would be good, as would some mirin.
          </li>
          <li>
            Preheat your oven to 450, then cook the tenderloin for 12-15
            minutes, or until cooked all the way through.
          </li>
          <li>
            Put your eggs in a pot with enough water to cover them. Bring to a
            boil and cover with a lid. It should take about 10 minutes to hard
            boil the eggs. Then pull them out and put them into a bowl of cold
            water to cool.
          </li>
          <li>
            While this is happening, pour or mix the stock/broth in a pot and
            bring it to a simmer. You can add soy sauce or mirin to taste.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once simmering, add the Top Ramen noodles. Do NOT add in the flavor
            packets. Let that cook.
          </li>
          <li>
            Now, we cut up all the toppings! Peel the eggs and slice them in
            half, cut the pork, kamaboko, bok choy, aburage, and green onion
            into thin slices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve up the noodles and broth in a nice deep bowl, then place all
            the ingredients in groups on top, and add in a few small rectangles
            of nori. Itadakimasu!
          </li>
        </ol>
